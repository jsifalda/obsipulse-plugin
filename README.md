# ObsiPulse - Your Writing Activity Visualised

## Overview

ObsiPulse is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows users to track their daily word count across all notes in their vault. It provides a visual representation of your writing activity, similar to GitHub's contribution graph, and offers a public profile feature for sharing selected notes.
More details available on [Obsipulse.com](https://obsipulse.com).
