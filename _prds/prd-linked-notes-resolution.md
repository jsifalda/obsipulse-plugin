# PRD: Linked Notes Resolution Before File Upload

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds linked notes resolution capability to the YourPulse Obsidian plugin. Before uploading files to the YourPulse platform, the plugin will resolve all `![[note]]` references by replacing them with the actual content of the linked notes. This ensures that published content is self-contained and complete, making it more readable and comprehensive for content consumers.

## Goals

1. **Content Completeness**: Ensure all linked notes are resolved before upload so published content is self-contained
2. **Improved Readability**: Make published content more accessible by including referenced note content directly
3. **Seamless Integration**: Integrate linked notes resolution with the existing dataview compilation pipeline
4. **Performance Optimization**: Resolve linked notes efficiently without significantly impacting upload performance

## User Stories

1. **As a note publisher**, I want linked notes to be resolved so that my published content is complete and readable
2. **As a content consumer**, I want to see the actual content of linked notes without having to navigate to separate pages
3. **As a plugin user**, I want the resolution to happen automatically before dataview compilation so the process is seamless

## Functional Requirements

1. **Linked Notes Detection**: The system must detect all `![[note]]` patterns in markdown content before upload
2. **Content Resolution**: The system must replace `![[note]]` references with the actual content of the linked note
3. **Pipeline Integration**: The system must integrate linked notes resolution with the existing dataview compilation pipeline
4. **Error Handling**: The system must handle missing or deleted linked notes gracefully
5. **Circular Reference Detection**: The system must detect and handle circular references between notes to prevent infinite loops
6. **Performance Optimization**: The system must resolve linked notes efficiently without significantly impacting upload performance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **External Link Resolution**: This feature will not resolve external links, only internal vault links
2. **Code Block Processing**: Linked notes within code blocks will not be resolved
3. **Cross-Vault References**: References to notes in other vaults will not be resolved
4. **Image Resolution**: This feature focuses on note content resolution, not image or media file resolution

## Design Considerations

The linked notes resolution should be implemented as a new compiler step that runs before the existing `DataviewCompiler`. This maintains the existing architecture while adding the new functionality.

**Proposed Implementation Structure:**

```
File Upload Pipeline:
1. Read file content
2. Resolve linked notes (NEW)
3. Compile dataview queries (EXISTING)
4. Upload to YourPulse
```

## Technical Considerations

1. **Integration Point**: The linked notes resolution should be added to the existing file modification handler in `main.ts` around line 405
2. **Dependencies**: Should leverage existing Obsidian API for file access and content reading
3. **Performance**: Should implement caching or memoization to avoid repeated resolution of the same notes
4. **Error Handling**: Should log errors for debugging while continuing with the upload process

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All `![[note]]` references are successfully resolved before upload
2. **Performance**: Upload time increases by less than 50% compared to current implementation
3. **Reliability**: No upload failures due to linked notes resolution errors
4. **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing dataview compilation

## Open Questions

1. **Depth of Resolution**: Should the resolution be recursive (resolve links within linked notes)?
2. **Content Formatting**: How should the resolved content be formatted when inserted?
3. **Caching Strategy**: Should resolved content be cached to improve performance?
4. **User Configuration**: Should users be able to disable linked notes resolution?
5. **Content Size Limits**: Should there be limits on the size of resolved content to prevent performance issues?

## Implementation Notes

The feature should be implemented as a new `LinkedNotesCompiler` class that follows the same pattern as the existing `DataviewCompiler`. This ensures consistency with the current codebase architecture and makes the feature easily testable and maintainable.
