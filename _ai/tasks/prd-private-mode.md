# Product Requirements Document: Private Mode Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Private Mode feature enhances the YourPulse Obsidian plugin by providing users with a local-first, offline-capable experience. When enabled with a valid license key, this feature allows users to operate the plugin without sending any data to external servers, prioritizing user privacy and offline functionality. The feature transforms all external interactions into local modal windows, ensuring complete data sovereignty while maintaining core functionality.

## Goals

1. **Privacy Enhancement**: Provide users with complete control over their data by enabling local-only operation
2. **Offline Functionality**: Allow users to use YourPulse features without internet connectivity
3. **License Key Integration**: Require valid license key to activate private mode, ensuring proper feature gating
4. **Seamless UX**: Maintain intuitive user experience while switching between online and private modes
5. **Local Data Preservation**: Use existing local data without server synchronization

## User Stories

1. **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want to activate private mode with my license key so that my data never leaves my local environment.

2. **As a user in an offline environment**, I want to use YourPulse features without internet connectivity so that I can continue working regardless of network status.

3. **As a user with a license key**, I want to toggle private mode in settings so that I can choose between online and offline operation based on my current needs.

4. **As a user in private mode**, I want to interact with YourPulse elements (status bar, ribbon, commands) and see local modal windows instead of external pages so that I can use features without internet dependency.

5. **As a user**, I want clear visual indicators when private mode is active so that I can easily understand the current operating state.

## Functional Requirements

1. **License Key Validation**: The system must validate the provided license key before allowing private mode activation.

2. **Private Mode Toggle**: The system must provide a toggle in the existing settings to enable/disable private mode when a valid license key is present.

3. **API Request Blocking**: When private mode is enabled, the system must prevent all outgoing API requests to external servers.

4. **Modal Window Replacement**: When private mode is active, the system must replace all external page redirects with local modal windows for:

   - Status bar clicks
   - Ribbon button clicks
   - YourPulse command executions

5. **Basic Modal Content**: The modal windows must display "hello" as initial content when private mode is active.

6. **Visual Indicators**: The system must provide different styling for YourPulse elements when private mode is active to clearly indicate the current state.

7. **Local Data Usage**: The system must use existing local data without attempting server synchronization when private mode is enabled.

8. **Feature Preservation**: The system must maintain all existing functionality that can operate locally when private mode is active.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Server Synchronization**: Private mode will not sync data with external servers, even when internet connectivity is available.

2. **Advanced Modal Features**: The initial implementation will show basic "hello" content only; advanced modal functionality is out of scope for this version.

3. **Data Migration**: The feature will not migrate or convert existing data formats.

4. **Offline Data Storage**: The feature will use existing local data storage mechanisms without creating new storage systems.

5. **License Key Management**: The feature will not handle license key generation, validation, or renewal processes.

## Design Considerations

1. **Visual Feedback**: Implement subtle but clear visual indicators (different colors, icons, or styling) for YourPulse elements when private mode is active.

2. **Modal Design**: Use consistent modal styling that matches the existing YourPulse design language.

3. **Settings Integration**: Integrate the private mode toggle seamlessly into the existing settings interface without disrupting current layout.

4. **User Experience**: Ensure the transition between online and private modes is smooth and doesn't require plugin restart.

## Technical Considerations

1. **API Interception**: Implement request interception to prevent API calls when private mode is active.

2. **Event Handling**: Modify existing event handlers for status bar, ribbon, and command interactions to show modals instead of external redirects.

3. **Settings Persistence**: Ensure private mode setting persists across Obsidian sessions.

4. **License Key Integration**: Leverage existing license key validation mechanisms.

5. **Modal Implementation**: Use Obsidian's built-in modal system or create custom modal components.

## Success Metrics

1. **Feature Adoption**: Track the percentage of users with valid license keys who enable private mode.

2. **User Satisfaction**: Monitor user feedback regarding privacy and offline functionality.

3. **Error Reduction**: Measure reduction in API-related errors when private mode is active.

4. **Performance**: Ensure no performance degradation when private mode is enabled.

## Open Questions

1. **Modal Content Evolution**: What additional content should be displayed in the modal windows beyond the initial "hello" message?

2. **Offline Feature Scope**: Which specific YourPulse features should be prioritized for local-only operation?

3. **Data Synchronization**: Should there be an option to sync local data when switching from private mode back to online mode?

4. **Error Handling**: How should the plugin handle scenarios where private mode is enabled but local data is unavailable?

5. **User Education**: What onboarding or help content should be provided to explain private mode functionality?
